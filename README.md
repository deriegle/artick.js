# Artick.js | Opinionated Web Framework

Do you love using some of the latest advances in the web world such as React, Vue, Svelte or Angular? We do too, but we hate not being able to use the same language for the backend.
Sure there is express.js, but it is very unopinionated and sometimes it's nice for things to just be baked in.

That's where Artick.js comes in. We are a batteries included framework that allows you to pull in existing tools that you're used to,
so you can spend less time fiddling in the console and more time building the app that you've been dreaming of.

## Getting started

Download our CLI tool

```bash
npm i -g @artick/cli
```

Once you've installed the CLI, you can begin creating your app:

```bash
artick new my-best-app-now
cd my-best-app-now
artick start
```

Your server should start up and be running at http://localhost:3000
